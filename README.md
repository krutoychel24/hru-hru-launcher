To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13:** It's recommended to use these Python versions for optimal compatibility with PyInstaller. You can download them from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Ensure you add Python to your system's PATH during installation.
* **Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK):** Minecraft requires Java to run. Ensure you have a compatible Java version installed on your system.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/krutoychel24/hru-hru-launcher

    ```
2.  **Create a Virtual Environment** (highly recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
    * **On Windows (Command Prompt):**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **On Windows (PowerShell):**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
